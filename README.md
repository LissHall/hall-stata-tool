# Hall's STATA Toolbox

This is an Index Page for Hall's Stat tools.

1. General initial steps before your stata codings. ðŸ‘‰ [ini.do](/ini.do)
2. Install and update all specified `ssc` and `net` packages at once. ðŸ‘‰ [whichdep.ado](/README_whichdep.md)


# How to install
For `.ado` programs, you can try do install it using `github` in Stata.
For example, the `whichdep`:

```{stata}
    github install LissHall/whichdep
```



If you do not have `github` installed, try run this in your Stata:

```{stata}
    net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
```
